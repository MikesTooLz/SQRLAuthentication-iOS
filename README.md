SQRLAuthentication-iOS
======================

Library for SQRL authentication for iOS. This library allows for easy integration of a SQRL authentication client into any iOS app. More information about SQRL can be found at https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm

THIS LIBRARY IS OUTDATED. The SQRL protocol has changed drastically and this library hasnâ€™t kept up.
